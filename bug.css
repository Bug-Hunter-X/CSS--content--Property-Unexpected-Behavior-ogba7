The CSS property `content` is used with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to insert generated content. However, using it incorrectly, or without understanding its implications can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.  For example, using `content: url(someimage.jpg);` inside a selector like `div::before` will insert the image *inline*, not as a background. This might break the layout or cause unexpected overlap.
